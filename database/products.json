I appreciate that the bouquet will let ok fuller once it has bloomed but even still for the price this wasn't worth it. I added another \u00a310 worth of yellow and white roses just to fill the bouquet out, which considering what I'd already paid for them made this a really expensive gift. I've always ordered from Serenata so was surprised at how poor the bouquet actually was, I'm sure it's a one off though. Oh and I know this may seem petty but a grey bow was added to a bouquet full of bright yellow flowers so I took that off. So that wasn't very well thought out. Again, I'll still order on the future but I just wish the bouquet was fuller. ",
